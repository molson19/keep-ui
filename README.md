# keep-ui

Keep is a note taking service that mirrors [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/). The motivation behind this project is to have something tangible to build and try out new technologies on in order to grow and deepen my skills as an engineer and software developer.

## Mission

This is not a deliverable. Speed is not a priority. Take time to learn and try new things, be creative, be curious, and grow foundational skills as an engineer.

In general, I'll build the UI using JavaScript and will look to explore and use industry standard tools in the JavaScript ecosystem.

## Tools to explore

- React
- Redux
- Cypress
- SASS
- Webpack

## Steps

- Init node project
- Design the data model
